== VirusTotal LiveHunt Module

VirusTotal was founded as a free service that analyzes files and URLs for viruses, worms, trojans and other kinds of malicious content. In addition to the free services, VirusTotal offers several premium services. One of those premium services is LiveHunting.

LiveHunt leverages customer provided YARA rules uploaded and applied to all files sent to VirusTotal from all around the world, live. Whenever there is a rule match you get an immediate notification. Notifications can be viewed via the web interface, email alerts or retrieved through a REST API.

This module uses Filebeat's https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-httpjson.html[HTTP JSON input plugin] to query the notification queue and write the results, and companion metadata, to Elasticsearch. Additionally, this module leverages ECS fieldsets.
